<h1>Hello,</h1>

I'm Skyler, and I consider myself a general purpose nerd. I have an educational background or experience with programming, pure and applied mathematics, cognitive science, AI/ML, philosophy of science, language and mind, physics (esp. foundations of QM and GR) and game design.<br><br>
Here's <a href="https://github.com/j-s-n/">my github profile</a>, though unfortunately it mostly contains old projects and silly jokes as I can't make a lot of the stuff I've worked on public.<br><br>
One of my hobbies is playing, running and designing tabletop RPGs. A while back, I wrote a pretty popular article on how to make action scenes more interesting, which was hosted on <a href="https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/blog/making-combat-interesting">The Gauntlet blog</a>.<br><br>
I also made this very silly <a href="https://j-s-n.github.io/discount-npc-names/">NPC generator</a>, inspired by <a href="http://friendsatthetable.net">my favorite AP podcast</a>.<br><br>
While I'm talking about myself, one thing I'm proud of is that Jeff VanderMeer (the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00EGJ32A6/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1">Annihilation</a>) once <a href="https://electricliterature.com/are-we-alone/">quoted me in a speech</a>.<br><br>
Cool,<br>
Skyler
